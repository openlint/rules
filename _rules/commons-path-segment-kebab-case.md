{% raw %}
Part of the API Commons naming ruleset, which the common schema in every API Commons bounded context is written to (https://github.com/api-commons/schema-commons). The counts are providers, not files, with duplicate listings and shared specifications folded: 6,688 providers across 107 bounded contexts, read from OpenAPI the providers published themselves. They are re-measured and rendered into the ruleset each time a context is added. Opt-in, not recommended by default.

Tested with Spectral 6.15.0: all 98 common OpenAPI documents are clean, and Pipedrive's published v2 OpenAPI is flagged where its names differ from the common vocabulary (add_time and update_time, /activityFields).
